# Computer-Vision

This repo contains the labs completed under the Computer Vision course at University of Amsterdam.
- Under the 'Photometric_stereo_color' there are phyton scripts developed in the first lab. It involves constructing surfaces using Albedo and Surface Normals, Color Spaces conversions, decomposition intro intrinsic components and Grey-Worlds Algorithm.
