# Computer-Vision

This repo contains the labs completed under the Computer Vision course at University of Amsterdam.
- Under the *'Photometric_stereo_color'* there are Python scripts developed in the first lab. It involves constructing surfaces using **Albedo and Surface Normals, Color Spaces conversions, decomposition intro intrinsic components and Grey-World Algorithm**.
- Under the *'neighbourhood_processing_filter'*, we investigate **Gaussian and Gabor filters, techniques for denoising images, Sobel kernels and Laplacian of Gaussian for edge detection and image segmentation**. The report can be found under *Lab2*.
- Under the *'Harris_Corner_Detector_Optical_Flow'*, we investigate feature tracking algorithms like **Harris Corner and Shi-Tomasi** and we track different objects across moving frames with **Lucas Kanade algorithm** which is based on the notion of **optical flow**. The report can be found under *Lab3*
- Under the *'Image_alignment_stiching'*, we investigate the SIFT algorithm as well as the RANSAC method to calculate the optimal affine transformation between 2 images. The report can be found under *Lab4*
- Under the *'Image_Classification'*, we investige the **bag of words** method using **SVM** to classify the images from STL10 and **CNNs** to classify the images from CIFAR10. Using the network trained on CIFAR10, we make use of **transfer learning** to classify the images from STL10. The report can be found under *Lab4*.
